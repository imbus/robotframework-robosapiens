    RoboSAPiens: SAP GUI-Automation for Humans
    
    In order to use this library the following requirements must be satisfied:
    
    - Scripting must be [https://help.sap.com/saphelp_aii710/helpdata/en/ba/b8710932b8c64a9e8acf5b6f65e740/content.htm|enabled on the SAP server].
    
    - Scripting Support must be [https://help.sap.com/docs/sap_gui_for_windows/63bd20104af84112973ad59590645513/7ddb7c9c4a4c43219a65eee4ca8db001.html?locale=en-US|enabled in SAP GUI] .
    
    == New features in Version 2.4 ==
    
    - Support for SAP Business Client
    - Documentation for automating embedded browser controls (Edge only)
    
    == New features in Version 2.0 ==
    
    - Support for SAP GUI 8.0 64-bit
    - New keyword "Select Tree Element"
    - New keyword "Get Row Count"
    - New keyword "Scroll Contents"
    - New keyword "Select Menu Entry"
    - New keyword "Untick Checkbox Cell"
    
    == Breaking changes with respect to Version 1.0 ==
    
    - The keyword "Fill Cell" takes three positional arguments instead of two
    - The keyword "Read Statusbar" returns a dictionary instead of a string
    - Renamed the keyword "Export Dynpro" to "Export Window"
    - Renamed the keyword "Export Function Tree" to "Export Tree Structure"
    - Renamed the keyword "Select Text Line" to "Select Text"
    - Removed the keyword "Export Spreadsheet"
    
    == Getting started ==
    
    In order to login to a server execute the following (adjust the path accordingly):
    
    | Open SAP             C:${/}Program Files (x86)${/}SAP${/}FrontEnd${/}SAPgui${/}saplogon.exe
    | Connect to Server    My Test Server
    | Fill Text Field      User              TESTUSER
    | Fill Text Field      Password          TESTPASSWORD
    | Push Button          Enter
    
    For a hands-on tutorial watch the talk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7fYngdY7NI|RoboSAPiens: SAP GUI Automation for Humans] presented at the Online RoboCon 2024.
    
    == Dealing with spontaneous pop-up windows ==
    
    When clicking a button it can happen that a dialog window pops up.
    The following keyword can be useful in this situation:
    
    | Click button and close pop-up window
    |     [Arguments]   ${button}   ${title}   ${close button}
    |  
    |     Push Button       ${button}
    |     ${window_title}   Get Window Title
    |  
    |     IF   $window_title == $title
    |         Log               Pop-up window: ${title}
    |         Save screenshot   LOG
    |         Push button       ${close button}
    |     END
    
    == Automating embedded browser controls using Browser Library ==
    
    Configure the following environment variable in Windows:
    
    | Name:  WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS
    | Value: --enable-features=msEdgeDevToolsWdpRemoteDebugging --remote-debugging-port=4711
    
    Start SAP Logon or SAP Business Client.
    
    In SAP Logon go to ``Options > Interaction Design > Control Settings`` and set "Browser Control" to "Edge".
    
    In SAP Business Client go to ``Settings > Browser`` and set "Primary Browser Control" to "Edge".
    
    Log in to the SAP server and execute the transaction that contains one or more browser controls.
    
    Start a Chromium-based browser, e.g. Microsoft Edge, and open the URL ``chrome://inspect``.
    
    Click on "Configure...", add the entry ``localhost:4711`` and delete all other entries.
    
    Under the heading "Remote Target" the pages from all browser controls will be shown. In order to open the Developer Tools for a page click on "inspect".
    
    In Robot Framework call the following keyword from [https://robotframework-browser.org/|Browser Library]:
    
    | ``Connect To Browser   http://localhost:4711   chromium   use_cdp=True``
    
    Get the ``id`` of the page you want to automate using the following keyword:
    
    | Get Page Id by Title
    |     [Arguments]    ${title}
    | 
    |     ${browsers}    Get Browser Catalog
    |     ${contexts}    Set Variable           ${browsers}[0][contexts]
    |     ${pages}       Set Variable           ${contexts}[0][pages]
    | 
    |     FOR  ${page}  IN  @{pages}
    |         IF  '${page}[title]' == '${title}'
    |             Return From Keyword    ${page}[id]
    |         END
    |     END
    |
    |     Fail    The page '${title}' is not open in the current browser.
    
    Activate the page with:
    
    | ``Switch Page    ${id}``
    
    *Hint*: If the element you want to automate is inside an ``iframe`` or a ``frame``, prepend the (i)frame selector to its selector.
    Example:
    
    | ``Highlight Elements    id=frameId >>> element[name=elementName]``
    
    == Keeping secrets safe ==
    In order to prevent secret leakage into the Robot Framework protocol disable the logger before calling sensitive keywords:
    
    | ${log_level}       Set Log Level    NONE
    | Fill Text Field    ${locator}       ${password}
    | Set Log Level      ${log_level}
    
    == Assertions ==
    Using the following helper keyword custom assertions can be implemented.
    Currently ``${state}`` can only be Found or Changeable.
    
    | Element should be ${state}
    |     [Arguments]    ${keyword}    @{args}    ${message}
    |     [Tags]         robot:flatten
    |     
    |     TRY
    |         Run Keyword    ${keyword}    @{args}
    |     EXCEPT  Not${state}: *    type=GLOB
    |         Fail    ${message}
    |     END
    
    For example, the following keyword asserts that a given text field should be present:
    
    | Text field should be present
    |     [Arguments]    ${locator}
    | 
    |     Element should be Found    Select Text Field    ${locator}    message=The text field '${locator}' is not present.
    
    And the following keyword asserts that a given cell should be present in a table:
    
    | Cell should be present
    |     [Arguments]     ${row}    ${col}
    | 
    |     Element should be Found    Select Cell    ${row}    ${col}    message=The cell '${row}, ${col}' is not present.
