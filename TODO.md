# C#

## Export tree

- As a list of lists

## Export form

Refactor this function:
    - Simple and clear
    - Do not depend on a CSV library


## New implementation of the component DB

- With the right data structures the code will be simple


## Refactor the code for finding components

- Optimize for adding new search strategies (functional extensibility rather than OO)


# Python

## Compare forms

Given two CSV files corresponding to the data models of two forms,
determine the differences between the two files.

Given the screenshots corresponding to the two forms, draw rectangles
around the elements that differ in the two forms. Attach the screenshots
to the RF report.
