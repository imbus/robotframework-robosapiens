- Test all keywords (inc. Export Form and Export Tree)

- Build the wheel with the self-contained and trimmed RoboSAPiens.exe + DLLs

- Update the docs
    - Installing the .NET Runtime is no longer necessary
    - There is no HTTP server and no port argument
    - Export Form: A JSON file is generated

Future plans:

- Try AOT compilation

- Embed the self-contained, trimmed, single exe RoboSAPiens in the Photino-based RoboSAPiens Playground

- Embed the self-contained, trimmed, single exe RoboSAPiens in a TB Plugin (Java ITEP Wrapper)
